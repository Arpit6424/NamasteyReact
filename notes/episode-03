if we want to make shortcurt to run or build our project then change in script in json file

"scripts": {
"test": "jest",
"start": "parcel index.html",
"build": "parcel build index.html"
},

- just write npm run start or nmp start to run in development mode

- just write npm run build for production build

//Recat.createElement => object => HTMLElement(render)

//JSX - is not HTML in JS
// JSX - is HTML/XML like syntax
//parcel transpile JSX code before it reach to JS engine
//parcel also does not transpile but parcel gives to babel to done this job

//First JSX convert to React.createElement then this React.createElement(object ) render and converted to HTMlelement

//if there are multiple line in JSX then it is mandotary to use (). inside round bracket you have to write JSX

// React component
// Class Based Component - Old
// Functional Component - New

//A function which returns a JSX is known as componet
// or a function which return a react element is knowm as a component

Q - What is component Composition

- Componet inside another componet is known as component composition

we can also declare as normal JS function
const Title = function () {
return <h1>Title</h1>;
};

- you can write any JS code inside JSX by using {}
- if can call Title function inside a component {Title()}

- Different way to call component/function
{Title()}
<Title/>
<Title> </Titel>

-JSX can have only one parent element

- React Fragment
- if you dont want to use use div or other componet as parent you can use
- Recat Fragement behave like empty tag
  <React.Frament>
  .
  //other code
  .
  </React.Fragement>

  -other way
  -just write,JSX provide empty tag it is another way to write React Fragment
  <>
  .
  //other code
  .
  </>

  we can write fragment inside fragment
  <>
  <>
  </>
  </>
