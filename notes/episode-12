-Separation of concern
-redux vs redux toolkit

- how we mutate state directly in redux(immer library used for that)
- how to make immutable copy of object
- RTK Query Overview(previous we use middleware and redux thunk)

# Redux toolkit

- Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
- Build our store
- Connect our store to our app
- Slice(cartSlice)
- dispatch(action)
- Selector

- configureStore is used to create the store in the redux/toolkit
- Provide which comes from react-redux act as bridge between redux/toolkit store and react application store
  Provider takes props as name store and store name {appStore}

-Redux is not a part of react. Redux is defferent library it you can
build small-medium and even large application without use of redux or other state mangemnet library.
redux is not mandatory to use in all react appplication

--Other state mangemnet library
--Zustand

--By using redux it is easy to debugg
--we have redux dev tool in brower by which it is easy to debug

- When subscribe to the store make sure you subscribe to the right portion, otherwise it will huge loss in performance.
